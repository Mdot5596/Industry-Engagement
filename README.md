# 💭 Reflection
I’ve found this module incredibly beneficial — it’s helped me actively step into the industry and explore potential career paths after education. It’s given me the opportunity to grow as a game developer through participating in multiple game jams and creating a personal website to showcase my work.

I now feel more connected to the industry, especially through platforms like LinkedIn, where I’ve built a strong network within the game development community. This allows me to stay informed and engaged with the current trends and developments in the field.

# 🙏 Special Thanks
I’d like to give a big thank you to Tony Edwards for being an awesome teacher throughout this module, he has taught me a lot :)
